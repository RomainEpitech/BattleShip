How to use it ?
================

Once you start the game, you can right-click to rotate the ship and left-click to place it. After confirming the placements, the battle can begin! If you miss a shot, a laughing GIF will appear, and if you hit an enemy boat, an explosion GIF will be displayed. The game is still under development, so if you notice any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to contact me. Your feedback is greatly appreciated.
